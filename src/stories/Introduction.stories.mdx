<Heading type='1'>CFPB Design System React</Heading>

This library contains React implementations of the [CFPB Design System's] components and patterns. 

<Heading type='2'>Installation</Heading>

The `cfpb/design-system-react` library has not yet been released as an NPM package but can be integrated into your project by adding it as a "repository" dependency. 
 
In your `package.json`:
```
"dependencies": {
  "design-system-react": "cfpb/design-system-react"
}
```

<Heading type='2'>Components - Verified vs Draft</Heading>
This library is still in it's early stages of developement, with lots of changes expected in the coming months.  You will notice two subsections in the navigation sidebar: `Components (Verified)` and `Components (Draft)`.  
 
`Verified` components have been thoroughly reviewed for consistency with their [Design System] counterparts and can be considered unlikely to change in the near future. 

`Draft` components should be viewed as works-in-progress and may still undergo breaking changes in the near future in order to align their implementations with the [Design System].
